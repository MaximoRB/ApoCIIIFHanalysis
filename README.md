Exploring Apo C-III's impact on heart health and treatment in dyslipidemia: Relevance for Brazil's SUS

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a sub diagnosticated codominant genetic disease, whose patients commonly present early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disorders. Besides the reduction in the quality or lifetime, this condition boosts the global cardiovascular burden for healthcare.
Apropos of analyzing the influence of Apolipoprotein (Apo) C-III genetic variants on the Brazilian FH population, statistical analyzes were performed on a cohort of 165 FH patients with determined lipid profile and known Apo CIII genotype for rs5128, rs4225 and rs4520.
An alarming finding obtained by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve concerning total cholesterol responsiveness to pharmacotherapy classified 63.2% of FH patients under statin, ezetimibe and/or fibrate therapy as non-responders since they donâ€™t accomplish lipid levels equivalent to non-affected patients. 
Apo C-III analysis revealed that rs5128 GC and rs4520 TC genotypes were associated respectively to lower levels of Apo A (p-value = 0.0424), and higher triglycerides values (p-value = 0.0281) when compared to both variants CC homozygosis. This implies a higher cardiovascular risk in the presence of corresponding alleles G and T. No association was found concerning rs4225 or by the concurrent presence of these alleles under statistical significance of 0.05. Additionally, apolipoproteins A and B concentrations exhibited correlations to lipoproteins levels and cardiovascular events.
The results suggest the use of a more complex lipid panel including genetic apolipoprotein cluster investigation to better assist FH diagnosis and guarantee effective personalized pharmacological aid to this population.
